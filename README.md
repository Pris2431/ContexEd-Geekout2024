##Overview

We are pleased to present ContextEd, an innovative solution developed during the 3 day bootcamp in GeekOut, an esteemed technology event organized by GovTech Singapore. GeekOut aims to foster innovation, collaboration, and learning within the tech community through a variety of activities such as fireside chats, workshops, and hackathons. This event provides a platform for tech enthusiasts to connect, share knowledge, and develop solutions to real-world problems through intensive, hands-on experiences.

##Project Description

ContextEd is an interactive learning application designed to bridge the gap between academic concepts and real-world applications. The app offers bite-sized topics across various disciplines, including finance, engineering, and mathematics. One notable feature of the app is the streak system, visually represented as a bookshelf. As users engage with the app daily, a book gradually fills the bookshelf, symbolizing a month of consistent learning.

The app's design emphasizes concise information delivery through individual cards, each providing clear titles and explanations of concepts or terms relevant to practical, real-life scenarios. This approach encourages students to connect their academic learning with real-world applications and innovations, making education more relevant and engaging.

##Objective

Our objective with ContextEd is to foster continuous learning and curiosity. We aim to motivate students to recognize the value of their education by providing interactive and practical insights that enhance their understanding and application of academic knowledge.
